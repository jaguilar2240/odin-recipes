            Tacos al pastor; thin slices of shaved pork, placed on a tortilla and
            topped with onions, chopped cilantro, pineapple chunks, and salsa.
        <h3>Ingredients (serves 10)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong> 5 lb</strong> boneless pork shoulder</li>
                <li><strong>3 tbsp</strong> achiote paste</li>
                <li><strong>2 tbsp</strong> guajillo chilli powder</li>
                <li><strong>1 tbsp</strong> garlic powder</li>
                <li><strong>1 tbsp</strong> dried oregano</li>
                <li><strong>1 tbsp</strong> cumin</li>
                <li><strong>1 tbsp</strong> salt</li>
                <li><strong>1 tbsp</strong> pepper</li>
                <li><strong>3/4 cup</strong> white vinegar</li>
                <li><strong>1 cup</strong> pineapple juice</li>
                <li><strong>1 pineapple</strong> skinned and sliced into 1 inch</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Slice the pork shoulder into about 1-centimeter (¼ in) slices,
                    then transfer to a large dish or bowl. In a medium bowl, combine
                    the achiote paste, chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, cumin, 
                    salt, pepper, vinegar, and pineapple juice, mashing and stirring
                    until smooth with no lumps. Pour the marinade over the pork 
                    slices, then toss to make sure they are coated on all sides. 
                    Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, then refrigerate for at least
                    2 hours or up to 3 days.
                </li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with 
                    parchment paper or aluminum foil.
                </li>
                <li>Place a slice or two of the pineapple on the baking sheet. Take
                    a wooden skewer and push it directly in the middle of the 
                    pineapple. Remove the pork from the fridge and push the slices
                    through the skewer, layering one after the other until there is
                    a 1-inch (2 ½ cm) gap at the top. Push another pineapple slice
                    on top.
                </li>
                <li>Bake for about 1½ hours, until the pork is slightly charred on
                    the outside and deep red. Rest the meat for about 10 minutes, 
                    then carve off thin slices of pork and roasted pineapple.
                </li>
                    <li>To assemble, place some pork on the tortillas, followed by
                    a few pieces of pineapple, a sprinkling of onion, a pinch 
                    of cilantro, and a spoonful of salsa, and some diced 
                    avocado. Serve with lime wedges.
                </li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
