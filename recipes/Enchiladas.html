            Creamy, cheesy, and so very easy—these comforting chicken enchiladas are slathered
            in tangy green enchilada sauce and are everything you’re craving today (and, let’s
            be honest, every day).
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>4 cups</strong> cooked, shredded chicken</li>
                <li><strong>2 tbsp</strong> taco seasoning</li>
                <li><strong>3 cups</strong> mozzarella, shredded</li>
                <li><strong>3 cups</strong> monterey jack, shredded</li>
                <li><strong>1 cup</strong> sour cream</li>
                <li><strong>10</strong> corn tortillas</li>
                <li><strong>1 (28 oz) can</strong> green enchilada sauce</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Season some shredded chicken—if you’re like us and usually have some cooked
                    chicken in the fridge, use that! If not, you can use the meat from a 
                    store-bought rotisserie chicken.</li>
                <li>Toss the chicken with shredded Monterey Jack cheese and mozzarella—these 
                    mild, milky cheeses melt like no other, and meld beautifully with this 
                    enchilada recipe’s sour cream-based filling.</li>
                <li>Warm the tortillas and give them a dip in some green enchilada sauce 
                    (from a can—this recipe is all about ease) before you fill and bake them.</li>
                <li>Fill, roll and arrange the tortillas in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour green 
                    enchilada sauce over the whole gorgeous mess, top with a little more cheese,
                    and bake until bubbly. Since the chicken is cooked, all the bake needs to do
                    is help the whole thing cohere—once the cheese is really melted and 
                    bubbling, your green enchiladas are done!
